# Verification

## Automated checks

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 --with pytest --with pytest-asyncio --with pyyaml --with python-telegram-bot==22.8 python -m pytest -q
```

CI runs the suite on Python 3.11–3.14. Telegram, STT, and LLM network calls are simulated. Real PTB objects and request serialization are exercised separately from the lightweight unit fixtures.

History checks must cover one-time opt-in, private-chat defaults, explicit scope overrides, create/edit/delete capture, correction classification, restart/retry behavior, partial final writes, contact renames and ambiguity, bounded date/text queries, retention, catalog rebuilds, and CLI failure exits.

Native-handler checks must demonstrate that Business voice/audio is consumed before the ordinary media handler, unrelated messages continue normally, and text history observation does not spend an LLM call. The transcript surfaces must retain the intended `business_connection_id`, complete text, and UTF-16 entity positions.

## Controlled live smoke

Use an explicitly selected test Business conversation and the intended Hermes profile. These steps contact Telegram; the automated suite does not execute them.

1. Install the branch into the selected profile, enable the plugin, and restart its gateway. Check registration and errors in that profile's logs.
2. With history disabled, send a text message and verify that no history record is created.
3. Enable history. Send and edit text from each side; confirm `history show --contact ...` reports the events and contact names.
4. Delete an original message and separately delete/resend a small correction. After the configured window, inspect `history deletions` for distinct classifications.
5. Restart the gateway and verify existing records remain readable without duplicate events. Check `history verify` and catalog recovery.
6. Send short incoming/outgoing voice notes and a round video note. Verify one logical transcript per source and outgoing caption behavior in Telegram clients.
7. Send an attached speech recording and a tagged music file. Check that the speech is transcribed and music is skipped without an agent turn.
8. Exercise cleanup with the configured Gemini model and trust allowlist. Compare Russian, English, and mixed-language examples containing names, dates, amounts, negations, and long paragraphs against raw STT. Record fidelity and time to visible text.
9. Disable/remove the plugin and restart. Confirm ordinary Hermes Telegram behavior still works.

Keep evidence free of real contact details and message content. Record Hermes/PTB/Python/model versions and distinguish simulated checks from live Telegram/model results.

## Documentation images

The transcript illustration depicts implemented delivery shapes. The history image contains actual CLI output captured from synthetic Business updates. The assistant illustration is explicitly a future-design concept. All use fictional content and have editable HTML sources in `docs/images/src/`.

Render with `agent-browser --engine chrome`, inspect the image, and check for clipped text before replacing PNGs. A design illustration is not evidence of Telegram client rendering or successful delivery.
